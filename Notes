If builing fails try to download a major release manually and extract it to NDK/sources -> rename directory to ffmepg

+ Always check if download links are active (links can change), because then instead of the archive the html file is downloaded and named exactly like the archive (extracting fail)

For android builds use arm_pie configuration
